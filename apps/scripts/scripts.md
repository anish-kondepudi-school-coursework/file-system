## Scripts

Below are the edge cases I'm thinking of to write tests for

1. Writing large file that's larger than actual disk space
2. Reading out of bounds of small file
3. Creating, Writing, and Reading from multiple files
4. Writing/Reading small file with offsets
5. Writing/Reading medium file with offsets
6. Writing/Reading large file with offsets
